[Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/i-bishalb/MachineLearningProjects/blob/main/Sentiment_Analysis/Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb): 
          In this project, I have utilized **NLTK** tools such as **Tokenizer**, **PorterStemmer**, **stopwords**, **sklearn** tools such as **CountVectorizer**, **TF-IDF** and tools from **BeautifulSoup** to parse raw-text/html data to convert into machine learning processed vectors. The dataset is IMBD user review and the target variable being the sentiment(postive or negative). I have utilized logistic-regression to train my models after pre-processing. The models produces 91% accuracy with good numbers for both Precision and Recall.
